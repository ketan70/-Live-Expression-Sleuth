# Live Facial Expressions Detection Model
## This project implements a live camera facial expressions detection model from scratch using deep learning and computer vision.

## Technologies Used
Python | 
TensorFlow | 
OpenCV | 
Matplotlib | 

## Usage
Open Live Facial Expressions Detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells to start the camera and see the real-time facial expressions detection.

## Input and Output
The model takes as input a real-time video stream from the camera and outputs the detected facial expression labels (e.g. happy, sad, angry, etc.) on top of the video feed.
